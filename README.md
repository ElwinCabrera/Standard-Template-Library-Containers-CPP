# Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository was created for me to better understand and reinforce computer science fundamentals in data structures and algorithms. This project has two main goals. First, is to go over all of the core and important data structures and algorithms used in computer science. The second goal is to have at least 25 practice exercises per category in data structures and in algorithms. I hope you find this repository useful and informative as well.

Each topic (any folder within either data-structures or concepts-algorithms) has a readme file in that folders root, this readme would be an overview/explanation for the current topic. In addition, each topic has a sub-folder called exercises and inside that there is an additional readme file to be a sort of table of contents of all exercises associated with that topic.

## Where To Start and Go About Learning

When using this resource it is best to start with going over some core concepts in the [concepts](ds-algos/concepts) folder. After you have reviewed some important computer science concepts it is recommended for you to continue with data structures as most algorithms implement many of the core computer science data structures. Whether you are exploring data structures or algorithms it is best to check out how the specific topic is implemented first before moving in to their exercises.
