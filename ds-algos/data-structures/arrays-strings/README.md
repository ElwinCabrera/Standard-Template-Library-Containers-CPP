# Arrays and Strings

## Arrays

Arrays are one of the most basic and simplest data structure in computer science. An array stores a fixed size collection of elements of the same data type. In memory arrays are usually continuos so that each element can easily be identified by an array index.

## Strings

A string is a just an array that only stores a specific data type. The data type that strings store are usually ascii characters (letters, numbers and a couple special symbols). You can think of a string as a special type of array.
